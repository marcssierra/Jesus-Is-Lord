		<h3> <a href="Ephesians 6.html">Ephesians 6</a><br><p>A final word: Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on all of God’s armor so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil. For we are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies, but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against mighty powers in this dark world, and against evil spirits in the heavenly places.
	Therefore, put on every piece of God’s armor so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle you will still be standing firm. Stand your ground, putting on the belt of truth and the body armor of God’s righteousness. For shoes, put on the peace that comes from the Good News so that you will be fully prepared. In addition to all of these, hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery arrows of the devil. Put on salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
	Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere.
	And pray for me, too. Ask God to give me the right words so I can boldly explain God’s mysterious plan that the Good News is for Jews and Gentiles alike. Ephesians 6:10-19</p></h3><hr>
	<h4><a href="Psalms 34.html"> Psalms 34</a><br><p> I will praise the Lord at all times.
	I will constantly speak his praises.
	I will boast only in the Lord;
	let all who are helpless take heart.
	Come, let us tell of the Lord’s greatness;
	let us exalt his name together.
	I prayed to the Lord, and he answered me.
	He freed me from all my fears.
	Those who look to him for help will be radiant with joy;
	no shadow of shame will darken their faces.
	In my desperation I prayed, and the Lord listened;
	he saved me from all my troubles.
	For the angel of the Lord is a guard;
	he surrounds and defends all who fear him.
	Taste and see that the Lord is good.
	Oh, the joys of those who take refuge in him!
	Fear the Lord, you his godly people,
	for those who fear him will have all they need.
	Even strong young lions sometimes go hungry,
	but those who trust in the Lord will lack no good thing.
	Come, my children, and listen to me,
	and I will teach you to fear the Lord.
	Does anyone want to live a life
	that is long and prosperous?
	Then keep your tongue from speaking evil
	and your lips from telling lies!
	Turn away from evil and do good.
	Search for peace, and work to maintain it.
	The eyes of the Lord watch over those who do right;
	his ears are open to their cries for help.
	But the Lord turns his face against those who do evil;
	he will erase their memory from the earth.
	The Lord hears his people when they call to him for help.
	He rescues them from all their troubles.
	The Lord is close to the brokenhearted;
	he rescues those whose spirits are crushed.
	The righteous person faces many troubles,
	but the Lord comes to the rescue each time.
	For the Lord protects the bones of the righteous;
	not one of them is broken!
	Calamity will surely destroy the wicked,
	and those who hate the righteous will be punished.
	But the Lord will redeem those who serve him.
	No one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.<p></h4><hr>
