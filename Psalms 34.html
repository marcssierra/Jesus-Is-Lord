	<h1>Psalms 34
	1I will praise the Lord at all times.
I will constantly speak his praises.
2I will boast only in the Lord;
let all who are helpless take heart.
3Come, let us tell of the Lordâ€™s greatness;
let us exalt his name together.
4I prayed to the Lord, and he answered me.
He freed me from all my fears.
5Those who look to him for help will be radiant with joy;
no shadow of shame will darken their faces.
6In my desperation I prayed, and the Lord listened;
he saved me from all my troubles.
7For the angel of the Lord is a guard;
he surrounds and defends all who fear him.
8Taste and see that the Lord is good.
Oh, the joys of those who take refuge in him!
9Fear the Lord, you his godly people,
for those who fear him will have all they need.
10Even strong young lions sometimes go hungry,
but those who trust in the Lord will lack no good thing.
11Come, my children, and listen to me,
and I will teach you to fear the Lord.
12Does anyone want to live a life
that is long and prosperous?
13Then keep your tongue from speaking evil
and your lips from telling lies!
14Turn away from evil and do good.
Search for peace, and work to maintain it.
15The eyes of the Lord watch over those who do right;
his ears are open to their cries for help.
16But the Lord turns his face against those who do evil;
he will erase their memory from the earth.
17The Lord hears his people when they call to him for help.
He rescues them from all their troubles.
18The Lord is close to the brokenhearted;
he rescues those whose spirits are crushed.
19The righteous person faces many troubles,
but the Lord comes to the rescue each time.
20For the Lord protects the bones of the righteous;
not one of them is broken!
21Calamity will surely destroy the wicked,
and those who hate the righteous will be punished.
22But the Lord will redeem those who serve him.
No one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.</h1>
